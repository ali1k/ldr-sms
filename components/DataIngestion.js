                          Importing data to SMS platform can be done both manually and automatically based on the "Entity types" covered by a dataset, " Format and structure" of data and "Data access policy" defined for data to be imported. The latter is important as not all data can be accessed by every user, and different levels of accessibility apply, depending on subscriptions and on permission of the owners of datasets.

                          There are several steps followed in the lifecycle of linked data to extract and store the imported data into SMS triple store. The lifecycle starts by a basic (syntactic) conversion of data to RDF format without applying any specific vocabularies. This basic conversion is then enriched by applying several linking and enrichment services. Different services and scripts are used to convert unstructured and structured data to RDF. Techniques such as Named Entity Recognition (discussed later in the document) can be employed to extract named entities from textual content. A concrete example is recognizing research institutions and universities in a researcherâ€™s CV (Curriculum vitae), using named entity recognition by linking the CV to databases with background knowledge such as DBpedia.
                          For structured content, the tool will be selected based on the format. For example, <a href="http://openrefine.org/">OpenRefine</a> can be used to convert spreadsheet data to RDF.
